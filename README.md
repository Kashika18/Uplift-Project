# Uplift-Project

During the COVID-19 lockdown, human activity has been significantly reduced, leading to a significant reduction in industrial production, transport, construction and other activities, further reducing emissions.What once seemed impossible, the lockdowns made it possible but we have.


The data acquired by https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/ suggested a very arresting implication on the AQI levels around the globe but how big was this impact was the question.

Hence, we took it upon ourselves to use ML and feed the data Pre Covid in order to predict the AQI levels if lockdown didnâ€™t happen. Furthermore, we compared the prediction to the actual levels to indeed find a humongous change.
